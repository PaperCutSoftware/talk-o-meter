# Talk-o-meter for Google Meet

*Don't hog the meeting! Talk-o-meter adds an indicator to Google Meet to track, rank and compare how much you speak in meetings.*

----

Ever been told you speak too much in meetings? Or maybe you're as quiet as a mouse? 🙊  Whether your mouth’s too big or too small, Talk-o-meter is here to help. It's a simple concept - track and compare how much you and others talk in [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/).🗣️
 
## How to use:

1. Install the Extension
1. In your next Google Meet conference, you'll see some talk statistics
1. Try to keep your talk time close to the group average
 
## Origin
 
Talk-o-meter was found at the end of a rainbow and initially developed one sunny day by a talkative unicorn. Well, close, it was developed by the boss of a tech company who had the not too admirable superpower of talking too much on Google Meet.🤦‍♂️ When COVID-19 hit, the entire company realized that they were spending many hours each day on conference calls talking and talking and talking.😩  
 
It was then the crushing realization hit - maybe, just maybe, the boss was talking too much, reducing the ability for others to contribute and feel heard in meetings. 🤷
 
After moving rapidly from denial to acceptance in the grief cycle, the boss thought, “What if there was a way for everyone to measure and monitor how long they speak on all web calls?” 🤔
 
## How it works

Talk-o-meter tracks the number of seconds each participant talks in Google Meet and displays information in real-time, including:
Your rank (e.g. 1st, 2nd...)
An indicator if you're above or below the group average
The percentage of time you've talked in the meeting
 
For example, if you see "1st ^ 67%", that means you talk the most (ranked 1st), and are 67% above average. Hover your mouse over the number, and you'll see some more statistics including the percentage of time you've spoken in the meeting. A negative/minus number indicates your below average and maybe should offer a thought provoking opinion, or a long joke 😁
 
## Benefits
 
One of the strong predictors of an effective meeting (100% scientifically proven by the way) is that all participants contribute... Sorry, boss. 🤬 Talk-o-meter aims to rid the world of crappy meetings, one meeting at a time. It starts with downloading Talk-o-meter and sharing it with your team.🙌
 
Talkometer is free to download (and open source) and far more hygienic than putting a sock in your mouth.🧦 
If you’ve been sent this link by a friend (hint, hint), download it today and begin encouraging more voices to be heard within your team. 
 
Talk-o-meter is a Chrome Browser Extension that is only active when you're using Google Meet (A Google Meet Add-on). Privacy is assured and all talk time tracking statistics are visible to you and you only. It does not gather usage stats, nor does it track your conversations. It's a fantastic meeting tracker, but no warranty is provided and results may vary depending on the size of one's mouth 😬
